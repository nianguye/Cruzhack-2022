Food hack project 2022 for Cruzhack 2022

# Description
This is a project that I worked on with my group for the Cruzhack 2022 Hackathon. This project is a food website that takes in the input of what type of cuisine the user wants to eat along with their budget and returns suggestions of what foods to buy/make.
